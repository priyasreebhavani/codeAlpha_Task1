Basic Network sniffer

The network sniffer can be a hardware either a software which is used to monitor network traffic.
It is also called as packet sniffer because the data in a network is transmitted in the form of packets.
packet analyzer,protocol analyzer and network analyzer are its other names.
Sniffers work by examining streams of data that flow on a network i.e between computer or network devices.
The network sniffers opens upto all data traffic of the network by opening the system's NIC(Network Interface Card) to listen to that traffic.The software reads the data and 
performs data analysis or data extraction on it.
Basic Sniffers works with only TCP/IP packets but the well developed and sophisticated sniffers works with ethernet frames and low level networking protocols.
I am building a basic network sniffer in this project.
